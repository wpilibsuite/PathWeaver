/**
 * This interface represents a Spline - the function that describes the path
 * the robot will take when travelling across the field. This class is designed for use with
 * SplineSegment but can be used without or with an alternative implementation so long
 * as the behavior obeys the "as-if' rule.
 * <p>
 * Note: This interface places drag and drop constraints on implementors.
 * Implementors of this class should see {@link AbstractSpline} for
 * an example of setting up drag and drop for the spline and {@link SplineSegment}
 * for an example of setting up drag and drop for segments between splines.
 * <p>
 * Drag and drop is fundamental to Pathweaver, and implmentors of this interface
 * must abide by the following policies. Between {@link Spline} and {@link edu.wpi.first.pathweaver.path.Path}, the
 * following variables must get set in {@link CurrentSelections}:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link CurrentSelections#curPathProperty()}: To be set whenever a Path is clicked or dragged.
 * see {@link edu.wpi.first.pathweaver.path.wpilib.WpilibPath} and {@link SplineSegment} for examples.
 * <li>{@link CurrentSelections#curWaypointProperty()}: To be set whenever a Waypoint is clicked or dragged,
 * see {@link edu.wpi.first.pathweaver.path.wpilib.WpilibPath} for an example.
 * <li>{@link CurrentSelections#curSegmentStartProperty()} and {@link CurrentSelections#curSegmentEndProperty()}: To be set
 * whenever a SplineSegment (or functional equivalent) is clicked on or dragged.
 * </ul>

 * @see CurrentSelections
